# horiseon-code-refactor
- The code in both the Html and the CSS needed to be altered. The main purpose was to improve accessibility and search engine optimization. Also the code looks more clean, making it easier for anybody else that will be working on this code or reviewing as well as making it easier for me when coming back to it.

- I consolidated the classes, added alt text to images and used semantic Html. The code now has the minimum amount of CSS whilst still keeping the same appearance and only semantic Html was used.
